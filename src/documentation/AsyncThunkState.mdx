# Redux (RTK) Async Thunk state

- in this section, we will look at the use of Redux Toolkit's `createAsyncThunk` [RTK official docs](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk) that handles asynchronous actions in our Redux slices.
- we will also see how to handle the state of these asynchronous actions in our Redux slices.
- in our example, we will use the `fetchBooks` async thunk to fetch books from an API and handle the loading and error states.

As we see in the code example below, we can use the `createAsyncThunk` to create an async thunk action that:

- fetches books from an API and handles the loading and error states.
- creates new book posting to an API and handles the loading and error states.
- edits a book by ID posting to an API and handles the loading and error states.
- deletes a book by ID posting to an API and handles the loading and error states.

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The dilemma is how to track the state of these asynchronous actions in our `books` Redux slice,
because we will want to know the loading and error states for each of these actions.

```typescript
import { createSlice, PayloadAction, createAsyncThunk } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
// ... other imports

interface BooksState {
  data: Book[] | null
  loading: boolean
  error: string | null
}

const initialState: BooksState = {
  data: null,
  loading: false,
  error: null,
}

export const fetchBooks = createAsyncThunk<
  Book[], // Return type on success
  undefined, // Argument type, can be `undefined` for this case
  { rejectValue: string } // Rejection type, string as error message
>("books/fetchBooks", async (arg, thunkApi) => {
  const res = await fetch("/api/books")
  if (!res.ok) {
    const errorResponse = await res.json()
    throw new Error(errorResponse.error || "Failed to fetch books")
  }
  const data = await res.json()
  return data.data as Book[]
})

export const postNewBook = createAsyncThunk<
  Book, // Return type on success
  z.infer<typeof schemaCreateBook>, // Argument type - input values to create a new book
  { rejectValue: string } // Rejection type, string as error message
>("books/postNewBook", async (input, thunkApi) => {
  const res = await fetch("/api/books", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(input),
  })
  const data = await res.json()
  if (!res.ok || !data.success) {
    return thunkApi.rejectWithValue(data.error || "Failed to create book")
  }

  return data.data as Book
})

// ... other async thunks for edit and delete
```

#### For ease of demonstration, we will use the `fetchBooks` and `postNewBook` async actions for now.

#### These async thunk actions have a predefined state that we can track in our Redux slice

#### As you have noticed there is a generic interface for the `createAsyncThunk` function that allows us to define:

- the return type on success,
- the action's argument type,
- and the rejection type, ( for example `string` as an error message ).

#### Also, we can see that we are using the `thunkApi` to handle the rejection case by returning a custom error message.

btw, the `thunkApi` is an object that contains various utilities for working with thunks, including `dispatch`, `getState`, and `rejectWithValue` and plenty of other useful stuff.
more about could be found in the [RTK official docs](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk#thunkapi).

```typescript
const booksSlice = createSlice({
  name: "books",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    // ... reducers to handle synchronous actions
  },
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(fetchBooks.pending, (state) => {
        state.loading = true
        state.error = null
      })
      .addCase(fetchBooks.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.data = action.payload
        state.loading = false
      })
      .addCase(fetchBooks.rejected, (state, action) => {
        state.loading = false
        state.error = action.error.message || "Failed to fetch books"
      })
      .addCase(postNewBook.pending, (state) => {
        state.loading = true
        state.error = null
      })
      .addCase(postNewBook.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        if (state.data) {
          state.data.push(action.payload)
        } else {
          state.data = [action.payload]
        }
        state.loading = false
      })
      .addCase(postNewBook.rejected, (state, action) => {
        state.loading = false
        state.error = action.payload || "Failed to create book"
      })
  },
})
```

#### In the `extraReducers` section, we handle the state of the async thunk actions:

- `fetchBooks.pending`: sets the loading state to `true` and clears any previous error.
- `fetchBooks.fulfilled`: sets the data to the fetched books, sets loading to `false`, and clears any previous error.
- `fetchBooks.rejected`: sets loading to `false` and sets the error message from the action payload or a default message.
- `postNewBook.pending`: sets the loading state to `true` and clears any previous error.
- `postNewBook.fulfilled`: adds the newly created book to the data array, sets loading to `false`, and clears any previous error.
- `postNewBook.rejected`: sets loading to `false` and sets the error message from the action payload or a default message.

#### To mention, this state update is using `immer` under the hood, so we can mutate the state directly, the outcome will be an immutable state update.

Immer is a library [Why Immer - RTK docs](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/immer-reducers#why-immer-is-built-in) that allows us to work with immutable state in a more convenient way, and it is used by default in Redux Toolkit.
and the library is useful for handling large and complex objects immutably without the need to write complex code to create new objects.

## It still needs to answer a question on now shall I distinguish between the different async actions state in my Redux slice?

Let us take an example at:

<a
  href="https://github.com/SergeAtZeArtfinder/next-rtk-reading-club/blob/main/src/components/forms/BookForm/index.tsx"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
>
  src/components/forms/BookForm/index.tsx
</a>
file, where we have a form to create a new book. To handle post-submit logic
(like navigation or showing a toast)

```tsx
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux"
import type { AppDispatch } from "@/lib/redux/store"
import { postNewBook } from "@/lib/redux/slices/booksSlice"
// ... other imports

const BookForm = ({ book }: Props): JSX.Element => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch<AppDispatch>()
  const form = useForm<z.infer<typeof schemaCreateBook>>({
    /** ...form options */
  })
  // ... other form logic
  const onSubmit = async (values: z.infer<typeof schemaCreateBook>) => {
    // ... form validation and submission logic...

    // üëã HERE: üëá
    const createAction = await dispatch(postNewBook(values))

    if (postNewBook.fulfilled.match(createAction)) {
      addToast({
        title: "Success",
        description: "Book created successfully",
        color: "success",
      })
      router.push("/")
    } else {
      addToast({
        title: "Error",
        description: createAction.payload || "Something went wrong",
        color: "danger",
      })
    }
  }
}
```
