# Redux (RTK) with Next.js SSR prefetch state

- as we have seen in the previous example, we can use the `next-redux-wrapper` to set up Redux with Next.js.
- as we have seen in the <a href="https://github.com/SergeAtZeArtfinder/next-rtk-reading-club/blob/main/src/lib/redux/slices/booksSlice.ts" target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">code </a>:

```typescript
// src/slices/booksSlice.ts
import { HYDRATE } from "next-redux-wrapper"
// ... other code
const booksSlice = createSlice({
  //...
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder.addCase(HYDRATE, (state, action) => {
      // Merge the server state with the client state
      return {
        ...state,
        ...action.payload.books,
      }
    })
    // ... other cases
  },
})
```

- this is how we can handle the `HYDRATE` action to merge the server state for `books` for example with the client state.
- it could be used to prefetch the state from the server and merge it with the client state.
- it could be any other slice, and we can use the same pattern to handle the `HYDRATE` action for any other slice.

## How shall we use it to prefetch the state in our SSR phase of that rendering?

- we can use the `getServerSideProps` function to prefetch the state in the SSR phase of the rendering.
- let's take a look at the example of how we can use it in the `pages/index.tsx` file:

```tsx
import type { GetServerSideProps, NextPage } from "next"
import type { Book } from "@/types"

import BooksList from "@/components/books/BooksList"
import { setBooks } from "@/lib/redux/slices/booksSlice"
import { wrapper } from "@/lib/redux/store/wrapper"
import { getAllBooks } from "@/lib/db/books"

interface PageProps {
  [x: string]: unknown
}

const HomePage: NextPage<PageProps> = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <BooksList />
    </>
  )
}

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps<PageProps> =
  wrapper.getServerSideProps((store) => async () => {
    let books: Book[] | null = null
    try {
      books = await getAllBooks()
    } catch (error) {
      books = null
    }
    books && store.dispatch(setBooks(books))

    return { props: {} }
  })
```

- what has just happened here is that we have used the `getServerSideProps` function to prefetch the state in the SSR phase of the rendering.
- we have used the `wrapper.getServerSideProps` function to wrap our `getServerSideProps` function.
- this function will automatically dispatch the `HYDRATE` action with the state of the store.
- we have fetched the books from the database using the `getAllBooks` function and dispatched the `setBooks` action to set the books in the store.
- this will merge the server state with the client state when the page is rendered on the client side.
- this way, we can prefetch the state in the SSR phase of the rendering and use it in the client side.

### Now the client side will have the pre-fetched state

```tsx
// @/components/books/BooksList
import React, { useEffect } from "react"
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux"

import type { RootState, AppDispatch } from "@/lib/redux/store"

const BooksList = (): JSX.Element => {
  const books = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.books)

  // ... other code

  // As a fallback option: we could fetch books from the API if they are not already pre-fetched in the store.
}
```

## See in the applications

- you can see the full example of how to use Redux with Next.js SSR prefetch state in the

- Note: alternatively you can clone the [repository](https://github.com/SergeAtZeArtfinder/next-rtk-reading-club) and run it locally ( ask me for env vars )
- what you can observe is that the books are pre-fetched in the SSR phase of the rendering and are available in the store on the client side with `0` loading time
- You can observe it also in the devTools Redux tab: look for `"__NEXT_REDUX_WRAPPER_HYDRATE__"` action in the actions list to see when it is fired and with which payload
- If production version: you can observe it in the network tab, where the request to the API is not made, as the data is already available in the store
- You can check the Page Source and check the SSR rendered html - the books list will be already in.
- You can also check the browser console for window value `__NEXT_DATA__.props.pageProps.initialState` to see the prefetched redux state
