# Redux Toolkit is the official, recommended approach for writing Redux logic.

- It provides a set of tools and best practices that simplify the process of managing state
  in React applications, making it easier to work with Redux and scale the application on the Front End.

- It simplifies the standard Redux workflow by providing powerful
  utilities like `createSlice`, `configureStore`,
  and `createAsyncThunk`, which reduce boilerplate and make
  your code more readable and maintainable. Instead of manually writing
  action types, action creators, and reducers, Redux Toolkit enables
  developers to define everything in a more concise and structured way,
  greatly improving the developer experience.
- One of the key benefits of Redux Toolkit is that it enforces best
  practices out of the box.
  It includes good default configurations like development-mode checks
  for accidental state mutations and serializability, built-in `immer` for immutability and support
  for Redux DevTools, and integration with Redux middleware like `redux-thunk`.
- Redux Toolkit helps teams manage complex application state in a
  predictable and scalable way‚Äîparticularly in large apps or those
  requiring advanced patterns like server-side rendering, API data
  caching, or optimistic updates. This makes it especially useful in a
  Next.js application where performance, structure, and SSR support are
  crucial.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Demo application as example of using Redux Toolkit with Next.js

- Redux Toolkit is used in the demo application
- Next Redux Wrapper is used to connect Redux Toolkit with Next.js SSR prefetching and hydration; However it is not a requirement to use the Next Redux Wrapper.
  üòÉ You can use Redux Toolkit without Next Redux Wrapper, but you will need to handle the SSR prefetching and hydration manually, if you feel adventurous can create you own variations of the similar things
  that Next Redux Wrapper provides out of the box
- The demo application is a simple Next.js application that uses Redux Toolkit to manage the state of the application for the following basic CRUD features:

  - Listing of the books
  - Create new book ( by authenticated user)
  - Update book ( by authenticated user that created the book)
  - Delete book ( by authenticated user that created the book)

- The demo applications data flow can be debugged using
  - the Redux DevTools extension, which is integrated into the application and browser devTools.
  - the React DevTools extension, which is integrated into the browser devTools.
  - the devTools/console for `__NEXT_DATA__` global variable, which contains the current state of the application received from SSR phase.
  - devTools inspect the `View Page Source` to see the server rendered html
